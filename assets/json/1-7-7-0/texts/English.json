If an overheated reactor is not shut down, it will eventually lead to a nuclear meltdown.","Most submarines are equipped with stationary batteries that can be used as a temporary source of backup power in the case of a reactor failure.","Railgun shells and depth charges include a compartment that can hold additional explosives.","Passive sonar can be used to detect nearby sound sources without attracting unwanted attention. You can also get a rough idea of your surroundings based on the sounds reflected from the ice walls.","There are many ways to get past locked doors, including forcing them open with a crowbar or rewiring them to a button you have access to.","Stationary batteries are equipped with docks that can be used to charge battery cells.","Oxygen generators are equipped with docks that can be used to refill oxygen tanks.","Supercapacitors can deliver large bursts of power, but cannot store as much energy as batteries. They are often used to power railguns and other devices that require brief bursts of high current.","Nuclear reactors are equipped with an automatic control system that adjusts the power output to a suitable level when enabled. However, the system is not always fast enough to react to large fluctuations in power consumption.","The sonar imaging on the navigation terminal may become inaccurate if the terminal is damaged—make sure your engineers keep the terminal in a good condition!","When deploying a decoy, be sure to deactivate your active sonar for best results.","Attempting to rewire powered devices without adequate electrical engineering skills may get you electrocuted.","Welding tools are simple enough to be used by any submariner, but trained mechanics are generally faster welders and have a lower risk of injuring themselves with the tool.","All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on electrical devices, but electrical engineers get the job done much faster.","All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on mechanical devices, but mechanics get the job done much faster.","Captains are generally much more adept at maneuvering the submarine than the average sailor.","If the reactor on a sub is not able to produce sufficient power to run all onboard systems, try reducing the charge rate for the onboard batteries and supercapacitors, or regulate the times when the sub is running at full speed.","The electrical and mechanical systems on a sub will gradually degrade due to the harsh conditions and constant wear and tear. Be sure to have mechanics and engineers perform maintenance from time to time in order to avoid breakdowns at inopportune moments.","Breaking down alien artifacts in a deconstructor may provide you with exotic raw materials.","Some of the alien structures on Europa have been constructed of a metamaterial that's outstandingly resistant to physical damage, and as such has become an important subject of research to Europan scientists.","Special caution must be taken when bringing alien artifacts on board the submarine.","Very little is known of the presumably extinct alien civilization that built the ruins scattered all across Europa. The age of the ruins is also a mystery, since the self-repairing properties of the structures and devices make chronological dating methods wildly inaccurate.","No remains of the alien lifeforms that built the ruins scattered all across Europa have ever been discovered. The only life encountered inside the structures are the biomechanical entities that maintain and guard them.","While exploring ruins or caves, drop flares as often as possible to help mark a path out, should you need to make a hasty exit for some reason.","Watchers are docile but inquisitive creatures: Despite having no desire to attack submarines, they frequently approach ships to gaze at human activities.","Cannibalistic behavior is very common among crawlers. Killing one in a swarm may distract the rest as they enter into a feeding frenzy.","Mudraptors can easily tear their way through metal doors with their sharp beaks.","The so-called husk parasites slowly take over and consume the body of their host, eventually turning them into nothing but an empty exoskeleton controlled by the parasite.","Many creatures on Europa are protected by a strong shell, and are difficult to damage with conventional weapons, though there may be weak points in their armor.","Loud devices and sonar pings may alert nearby creatures.","Performing CPR without adequate medical skills may cause internal damage to the patient.","Opiates such as morphine and fentanyl are an effective way of treating injuries in an emergency, but regular use may eventually lead to a state of addiction and cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms.","Bleeding wounds can be treated with bandages and hemostatic agents. The patient may also need saline or blood packs to replace the lost blood.","Mental disorders such as psychosis are unfortunately common among submarine crews, particularly after ruin expeditions. If your crewmates start seeing or hearing things others don't see or hear, report it to a medical doctor immediately.","The medical doctors' main task is to keep the crew in a good shape, but a medic with a syringe gun and a bit of knowhow on poisons can also be very useful in fending off intruders.","Many drugs may have unintended side effects. Keep an eye on the patient and be ready to administer additional medications to counteract these side effects if necessary.","When using a diving mask, be careful not to mix up welding fuel tanks and oxygen tanks.","Diving masks let you breathe underwater, but don't offer any protection against the bone-crushing pressure outside the submarine. If there's a major hull breach, find a diving suit immediately.","In the event of a fire, burns are not the only thing to watch out for—fires can quickly consume all the oxygen inside the submarine.","Traversing the so-called Hydrothermal Wastes requires special caution. Not only are they abundant in wildlife, but the water currents caused by geothermal activity make navigation even more hazardous.","Some of the sessile lifeforms in Europa emit low-frequency sounds that may disrupt the submarine's sonar.","Europa is rich in natural resources, and an enterprising captain with a sharp eye and a plasma cutter may stand to make a tidy profit.","You can disguise yourself as someone else by wearing their ID card and something that covers your face.","It's possible to build voice-controlled systems by linking wifi components to the radio chat in the submarine editor.","The radiation belts around Jupiter make it impracticable to establish permanent settlements above Europa's surface, and as such almost all Europan outposts are located below its icy crust.","The dynamics of Europa's underwater ecosystem are still not fully understood, but it is believed that the base of the food chain is mostly formed by chemosynthetic bacteria.","The Europa Coalition started off as a trade and cooperation agreement between the two largest Europan settlements and a handful of private paramilitary groups, but gradually grew to become what is essentially the Europan government.","The much-ridiculed initiative to help submariners cope in a high-stress environment by including professional entertainers in the crews was promptly deemed a failure and discontinued.","Most vessels avoid venturing outside the tunnels and cracks within Europa's icy crust—the vast, empty Abyss between the surface layers and the rocky interior hosts many of Europa's largest and most dangerous inhabitants.","If left undisturbed for several years, a colony of ballast flora can eventually grow into a Thalamus, an intelligent organism capable of exerting some degree of control over the systems of the submarine it's inhabiting.","You can give context-sensitive commands when the cursor is over a usable object by holding down shift and opening the command interface.","Making trouble at an outpost hurts your reputation. A bad reputation might cause the inhabitants of the outpost to charge you a premium for their services, or, in more extreme cases, lead to a confrontation with their security.","Many Europan outposts don't recognize the Coalition's authority, although it is still powerful enough that few dare to openly oppose it. However, there are groups such as the Jovian Separatists who do fight against it, aiming to bring it down and create a more democratic society.","Behold the Watcher. Don't lose your mind.","Straddling the border between surface ice and the denser, rockier subsurface ice layer, the Europan Ridge is the area along the western-most slope of the Eye of Europa. Warmer water is convected into this area, allowing a wider array of life to subsist.","The Aphotic Plateau sits atop the western rim of an ancient impact crater known as the Eye of Europa. As with the neighboring Europan Ridge, the Plateau’s tunnel networks consist mostly of dark, rocky ice pressed as hard as any stone by the unimaginable weight of the ice above it.","Most of the human habitation on Europa is situated in the so-called Cold Caverns. Due to the cold water and relative proximity to the surface, this biome is biologically less diverse than others, primarily hosting moderate concentrations of crawlers and practically no vegetation.","Ice spires are enormous icy projections that sometimes burst through the subsurface tunnels under Europa's crust. Submarine crews are advised to avoid any contact with the spires, or to destroy any they come across, as the sharp edges can easily tear through a submarine's hull.","The poorly understood "Piezo Crystals" found in The Great Sea pose some extra challenges to crews travelling through the region: Navigating too close to one may cause disruptions in the submarine's electrical grid.","Administering drugs without sufficient medical knowledge may reduce the quality of the effects of the drug.","Generating more power than your sub's devices require leads to overvoltage, which can be used to push some devices (such as engines and pumps) past their normal capacity. However, a too-high voltage level may also damage devices.","The shrimp-like mantis was believed to have been hunted to extinction by Europan colonists, but recently a new, venomous subspecies was discovered. The cave-dwelling mantises are known to change the colors of their shells and are very effective at camouflaging themselves on cave walls, which most likely gave them an advantage over their bright-orange cousins.","Screaming at your crewmembers may draw unwanted attention from Europan wildlife.","Husks that survive to an advanced age may sometimes outgrow the shell of their host, forcing them to collect additional body parts from various sources in order to sustain their growth.","The Eye of Europa, and the strange gravitational phenomenon around it, has puzzled scientists ever since it's discovery by the first unmanned missions to Europa. Conveniently for Europan colonists, the gravity around the Eye is close to that of Earth's, instead of the normal 0.13 G surface gravity elsewhere on the moon."],"campaignlabel":["Campaign"],"multiplayerlabel":["Multiplayer"],"customizelabel":["Customize"],"privacypolicy":["Privacy policy"],"tutorialbutton":["Training"],"newgamebutton":["New Game"],"loadgamebutton":["Load Game"],"joinserverbutton":["Server browser"],"hostserverbutton":["Host Server"],"subeditorbutton":["Submarine Editor"],"charactereditorbutton":["Character Editor"],"settingsbutton":["Settings"],"steamworkshopbutton":["Steam Workshop"],"creditsbutton":["Credits"],"quitbutton":["Quit"],"pausemenuresume":["Resume"],"pausemenusettings":["Settings"],"pausemenuretry":["Retry"],"pausemenusavequit":["Save and Quit"],"pausemenuquit":["Main Menu"],"pausemenuquitverification":["Are you sure you want to return to the main menu?

This is unfortunately so common that throwing every traitorous submariner out the airlock would be detrimental to the submarine fleets and the Europan labor force as a whole. The Code of Fair Disciplinary Actions provides guidelines for dealing with traitors or other troublesome crewmates in a just manner.\n\nLevel 1 Offenses:\nDescription: mostly harmless misdemeanors, "pranks," neglect of assigned duties. Acts that at most cause minor inconvenience to the rest of the crew.\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Notify the person of their misconduct and command them back to their duties. A baton or some other non-lethal tool may be used to accentuate the verbal commands. More severe disciplinary actions can be considered if the misconduct continues.\n\nLevel 2 Offenses:\nDescription: acts that may endanger the health of the crew or submarine, such as intentional mishandling of devices or substances.\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Similar to level 1 offenses, a simple disciplining can suffice, but depending on the misconduct security can deem it necessary to instead handcuff or detain the individual by other means\n\nLevel 3 Offenses:\nDescription: clearly hostile acts with the intention to cause severe injuries or the death of one or more crewmates.\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Disposing of the traitor as soon as possible is advised.

Besides the wildlife, the researchers faced gruelling difficulties posed by the dangerous radiation emitted from Jupiter and the intense cold and tremendous pressure of the Europan ocean.\n\nDespite all their hardships, Earth-born colonists were able to construct a handful of habitable outposts where a new way of life developed over many decades. A new system of governance was formed by a coalition of the largest, most influential cities on the moon. Different industries made their mark in the new world, including mining, manufacturing and chemical laboratories.\n\nOver the years, Europan society became more and more dissociated from Earth. Fifty years ago, contact was lost entirely, and no more supply ships have arrived since.\n\nSub-aquatic travel and vehicles are in a key role in this new society, scouting for new inhabitable locations, protecting citizens from creature attacks and establishing supply lines between stations as humanity ventures ever deeper to evade the lethal radiation from Jupiter above. The life of a crewmember aboard one of these submarines is a lucrative one, albeit dangerous and often short.\n\nYou have enlisted to serve on a yyyy-class submarine, docked at xxxx.

I've felt that keeping a log of conditions as unchanging as these icy waters is as beneficial as dumping a bucketful of boiling water in an attempt to warm them. But to my regret I see now that I've shirked my duties by not keeping a diary. This is my attempt at rectifying that mistake. What I've seen in my last days here must be recorded somewhere, even if here at the end of space it's too late for the reader. I will ask you to bear with me, because for my story to make sense, I need to start at the beginning.\n\nSince I was a young kid, something drew me towards the Eye at the center of Europa. That might seem a somewhat obvious remark, on account of the gravity anomaly that has been well observed by individuals much more intelligent than I, but I assure you that my attraction runs much deeper. At night I would often dream of peeling off the skin of a raptorbane, only to find a monstrous fiery eye staring back at me, lidless and unmoving. I would wake at my desk, looking at drawn images of concentric circles, and I could not remember drawing them.\n\nIn hopes of sating my curiosity and curing my incipient parasomnia, I hopped the first scout ship to the center."],"welcomemsg.endcaptainslog2":["Captain's log, part 2\n\nOn my first voyage I served as assistant. For a week, to be exact. The ship's mechanic succumbed to a parasite, effecting me being promoted to take his place. I learned the craft over months, slaving in the hot engine room. Perhaps it was the physical exertion or the fact that I was slowly but surely nearing the Eye, but my nights were peaceful and without nightmares. That changed when one night the ship was attacked and left wrecked and immobile. I, along with some other survivors were rescued by another passing ship and left at the nearest station. Not long after, nightmares returned.\n\nIt became clear to me that I had no choice but to keep heading for the Eye. But due to the location of the station, being in the frontier, few ships had any reason to be travelling deeper. To keep myself occupied while waiting for the opportunity, I worked as a shipwright. Days came and went, but no submarine crews were heading to the center.\n\nAfter a few years of toiling and restless nights I found myself with a sizeable nest egg. Enough to buy my own submarine. If no opportunity presented itself to me, I'd make my own, I thought."],"welcomemsg.endcaptainslog3":["Captain's log, part 3\n\nIt took some effort to hire a crew, but a promise of money will rouse the right type of seafarer. With a crew of six in a freshly refitted Coalition patrol sub, I was finally the captain of my own vessel, and in control of my own fate. I sailed from Sermilik shipyard. It would be the last time I'd see civilization.\n\nThe journey was unsurprisingly fraught with danger and the ship endured challenges both expected and unexpected. From creatures unseen in the more civilized Europa to hostile environmental features; undersea volcanoes and flora that assaults the ship from inside. Not all risk came from outside, either. The physical and psychological stress took its toll on everyone, and regrettably some of us were not as strong as others.\n\nI will not spend more time expanding on the obstacles, for whoever finds this log surely has faced the same. Suffice it to say, after a lengthy voyage, banged up and battle-worn the ship and its passengers reached the Eye. Like the eye from my dreams, it swallowed me whole in a fiery inferno."],"welcomemsg.endcaptainslog4":["Captain's log, part 4\n\nWhat is known about the Eye is that it is a gravitational anomaly near the heart of Europa. This has been hypothesized, studied and scientifically proven, yet the origin of the anomaly hasn't been found. It is my opinion that it is a gateway. To where, I don't know. The irony of seeking out the Eye in an effort to satisfy the curiosity that has eaten me alive for years upon years, only to reach it and be none the wiser is not lost on me.\n\nThe way back is sealed. Whatever anomaly sent me here is not present anymore. The complex seems to continue to the distance, and the walls have been impervious to any weaponry available to me.

We shape a balloon into an animal, but it is the emptiness inside that lets the balloon take its shape. We work with the substantial, but what is between the lines is what we use.\n\nIII. The highest Fun is not to seek to create Fun, but to allow yourself to become it. The serious person seeks to do Fun things, and finds that they cannot do them continually.

When a foolish person hears of the Grand Joke of the Universe, he laughs out loud at the very idea. If he didn't laugh, it would not be a joke, would it?\n\nV. The best Jesters are those the people hardly know exist. The next best is a Jester who is loved and praised. Next comes the one who is feared. The worst one is the Jester that is despised. When a great Jester has accomplished their task, the people say, "this was so much fun," oblivious of what’s upstream of the Stream of Fun, much like they are oblivious of the Grandest of Jesters, the Uppest of Upstreams, the Blankest of Slates.\n\nVI. As is the Blankest of Slates, so is the mind of the Jester. They see the mind of the people as their own mind. To those who are good they treat as good. To those who aren't good they also treat as good. They trust people who are trustworthy. They also trust people who aren't trustworthy.

Changing the natural is to stray from the Path of the Bike Horn. Those who do it will not have Fun in the end.\n\nVIII. With compassion, you will be able to be brave. With moderation, you will be able to bring Fun to the world. With humility, you will be able to guide others. To abandon compassion while seeking to be brave, or abandoning moderation while being amusing, or abandoning humility while seeking to guide will not lead to Fun.\n\nIX. The kite rises high and the Jester lets it soar; the kite string pops and the Jester lets it fly away. He has but does not possess, acts but does not expect. When his work is done, he forgets it.

What is the heaviest thing? asketh the spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.\n\nIs it not this: To descend to the deepest depths to tempt the temper?\n\nOr is it this: To feed on the fruit of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?\n\nOr is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim the pests and parasites within it?\n\nOr is it this: To love those who despise us, and to give one's hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us?\n\nAll these heaviest things the spirit taketh upon itself: and as a chalice in the shape of a man’s fortitude, it rejoiceth in its strength.\n\nBut then riseth a miasma from the chalice, for the man’s fortitude carrieth burdens of old, now stale and foul.\n\nThus speaketh the miasma to the spirit, "Thou shalt!"\n\nThe ideas and values of thousands of years in the air reeketh. "All the values of things embalming me. All values have already been created, and all created values—do I represent. Verily, there shall be no 'I will' any more." Thus speaketh the miasma.\n\nMy brethren, wherefore is there need of emptying the chalice? Why sufficeth not the fortitude of man, which renounceth and is reverent? To create new values—that, a mere man cannot accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the fortitude of man do.\n\nTo create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty and humanity: for that, my brethren, there is no need of the man. To assume the ride into new values—that is the most formidable assumption for a reverent spirit.\n\nBut tell me, my brethren, what is the value of an empty chalice? For is it not the wine that gives it purpose? Thus must we find a new wine, fresh and untainted, beyond the fortitude of man, yet within its grasp.\n\nAye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life, the fortitude of life itself. A fortitude readily within the grasp of those who dare to reach out, as if a Gift the world has handed us.\n\nThus comes the third and final metamorphosis, the Ascension: the man’s spirit filled with new life, the fortitude of man and the fortitude of the world as one.

Back when the Coalition was starting to gain a foothold on Europa, Tormsdale was by far the largest independent colony, and the Jovian People’s Movement obviously had strong support there. I suppose it was in a sense considered the headquarters of the independent colonies and the Movement. At that time, Europa was still somewhat democratic, and the general elections were coming up.”"],"EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1":["“Mm-hmm.”"],"EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.c1":["“Just a few weeks before the elections, there was a nuclear disaster in Tormsdale. Over a hundred people dead. And conveniently for the Coalition, almost all of them happened to be supporters of the Jovian People’s Movement. That was enough to tip the scales in their favor, and let them become the de jure government of Europa.”"],"EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1":["“That sounds a little too convenient to be a coincidence.”"],"EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1":["“Indeed.
