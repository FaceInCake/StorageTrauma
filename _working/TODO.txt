- Make recipe cards show item names and link to item page


-   Adjust search boost values and which fields it does/does not expand

- Replace all icons with feather icons

- Handle recipes having a fabrication limit (vending machines)
fabricationlimitmin="5" fabricationlimitmax="10"


- Handle outcondition not being 1.0
```<Fabricate suitablefabricators="fabricator" displayname="OxygenTankEmpty" outcondition="0.0">
    <RequiredSkill identifier="mechanical" level="20"/>
    <RequiredItem identifier="aluminium" amount="2"/>
</Fabricate>```



The wiki also doesn't mention whether this is before/after the Reputation modifier and whether its additive/multiplicative to it. Handling that will probably be another issue though.


- configure unit tests
